# instagram-user-classification-
Most of us put people in boxes (consciously or unconsciously), mainly basing our assumptions on their appearances. With this project, I would like to build an algorithm that does exactly that. Just with Instagram users, based on their appearance (pictures on their profile).  With an (un)supervised learning algorithm instagramers would properly get divided into groups.  I think this will be a fun project during this covid quarantine. &amp; if resulted in great performance, this could be used for a variety of objectives as well, such as automated dating applications.
