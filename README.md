# instagram-user-classification-
Most of us, consciously or unconsciously, during people watching put people in boxes, based solely on their appearance. With this project, I would like to build an algorithm that does exactly that. Just with Instagram users, based on their appearance (pictures on their profile).  With an (un)supervised learning algorithm instagramers would properly get divided into groups or labeled.  I think this will be a fun project during this covid quarantine. &amp; if resulted in great performance, this could be used for a variety of objectives as well.
